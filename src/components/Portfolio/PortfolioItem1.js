						The semester project January 22 we were to build a frontend for a e-commerce website with both
						customer-facing and admin sections. We were free to choose the theme and tool to create this website, my
						choice was using Bootstrap and SASS which was something I wasn't familier with. We also had to follow these
						bulletpoints for the assignment: Build a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart pages.
						Build admin pages to create, update and delete products. The website must be responsive on all devices.
						Building a checkout and payment system is not a part of the project.
